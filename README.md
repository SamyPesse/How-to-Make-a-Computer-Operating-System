How to Make a Computer Operating System
=======================================

**Caution**: This repository is a remake of my old course. It was written several years ago [as one of my first projects when I was in High School](https://github.com/SamyPesse/devos) so it's normal if some parts of the code look like "crap". The original course was in French and I'm not an English native. I'm going to continue and improve this course in my free-time.

**Source Code**: All the system source code will be stored in the `src` directory. Each step will contain links to the different related files.

**Contributions**: This course is open to contributions, feel free to signal errors with issues or directly correct the errors with pull-requests.

**Questions**: Feel free to ask any questions by adding issues. Please don't email me.

### What kind of OS are we building?

The goal is to build a very simple UNIX-based operating system in C++, not just a "proof-of-concept". The OS should be able to boot, start a userland shell, and be extensible.

How to Make a Computer Operating System
=======================================

Online book about how to write a computer operating system in C/C++ from scratch.

**Caution**: This repository is a remake of an old computing course. It was written several years ago [as one of my first projects when I was in high school](https://github.com/SamyPesse/devos). I am still refactoring parts as the original course was in French and I am not an native English speaker. I will improve this course whenever possible.

**Book**: An online version is available at [http://samypesse.gitbooks.io/how-to-create-an-operating-system/](http://samypesse.gitbooks.io/how-to-create-an-operating-system/) (PDF, Mobi and ePub). It was generated using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/).

**Source Code**: All system source code will be stored in the [src](https://github.com/SamyPesse/How-to-Make-a-Computer-Operating-System/tree/master/src) directory. Each step will contain links to the relevant files.

**Contributions**: This course is open to contributions, feel free to signal errors with issues or directly correct the errors with pull-requests.

**Questions**: Feel free to ask any questions by adding issues or commenting sections.

### What kind of OS are we building?

The goal is to build a UNIX-based operating system in C++, not just a "proof-of-concept". The OS should be able to boot, start a userland shell, and be extensible.

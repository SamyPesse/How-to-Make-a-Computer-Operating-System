## Chapter 3: First boot with GRUB

#### How the boot works?

When an x86-based computer is turned on, it begins a complex path to get to the stage where control is transferred to our kernel's "main" routine ("kmain()"). For this course, we are going to consider only a BIOS boot method and not the new UEFI one.

The BIOS boot sequence is: RAM detection -> Hardware detection/Initialization -> Boot sequence.

The most important step for us is the "Boot sequence", where the BIOS is done with its initialization and tries to transfer control to the next stage of the bootloader process.

During the "Boot sequence", the BIOS will first choose the "boot device" (floppy disk, hard-disk, CD, usb flash memory device or network). Our Operating System will first boot from the hard-disk (but it will be possible to boot it from a CD or a usb flash memory device).

The BIOS will read 512 bytes from the first valid bootsector (where the last two bytes are 0x55 0xAA), or lock up with an error message if it cannot find one. And it'll transfer these 512 bytes into physical memory starting at address 0x7c00 then starts running the code that now begins at 0x7c00.

When the BIOS transfers control to the bootsector, the bootsector code is loaded and running at physical address 0x7c00 and the CPU is in 16-bit Real Mode but our kernel will be only 32bits so we need a bootloader to read our kernel switch to protected mode and starts running it.

#### What is GRUB?

> GNU GRUB (short for GNU GRand Unified Bootloader) is a boot loader package from the GNU Project. GRUB is the reference implementation of the Free Software Foundation's Multiboot Specification, which provides a user the choice to boot one of multiple operating systems installed on a computer or select a specific kernel configuration available on a particular operating system's partitions.

To make it simple, GRUB is the first thing booted by the machine (a boot-loader) and will simplify the loading of our kernel stored on the hard-disk.

#### Why are we using GRUB?

* GRUB is very simple to use
* Make it very simple to load 32bits kernels without needs of 16bits code
* Multiboot with Linux, Windows and others
* Make it easy to load external modules in memory

#### How to use GRUB?

GRUB uses the Multiboot specification, the executable binary should be 32bits and must contain a special header (multiboot header) in its 8192 first bytes. Our kernel will be a ELF executable file ("Executable and Linkable Format", a common standard file format for executables in most UNIX system).

The first boot sequence of our kernel is written in Assembly: [start.asm](https://github.com/SamyPesse/How-to-Make-a-Computer-Operating-System/blob/master/src/kernel/arch/x86/start.asm) and we use a linker file to define our executable structure: [linker.ld](https://github.com/SamyPesse/How-to-Make-a-Computer-Operating-System/blob/master/src/kernel/arch/x86/linker.ld).

This boot process also initializes some of our C++ runtime, it will be described in the next chapter.

Multiboot header structure:

```
struct multiboot_info {
	u32 flags;
	u32 low_mem;
	u32 high_mem;
	u32 boot_device;
	u32 cmdline;
	u32 mods_count;
	u32 mods_addr;
	struct {
		u32 num;
		u32 size;
		u32 addr;
		u32 shndx;
	} elf_sec;
	unsigned long mmap_length;
	unsigned long mmap_addr;
	unsigned long drives_length;
	unsigned long drives_addr;
	unsigned long config_table;
	unsigned long boot_loader_name;
	unsigned long apm_table;
	unsigned long vbe_control_info;
	unsigned long vbe_mode_info;
	unsigned long vbe_mode;
	unsigned long vbe_interface_seg;
	unsigned long vbe_interface_off;
	unsigned long vbe_interface_len;
};
```

You can use the command ```mbchk kernel.elf``` to validate your kernel.elf file against the multiboot standard. You can also use the command ```nm -n kernel.elf``` to validate the offset of the different objects in the ELF binary.

#### Create a disk image for our kernel and grub

The script [diskimage.sh](https://github.com/SamyPesse/How-to-Make-a-Computer-Operating-System/blob/master/src/sdk/diskimage.sh) will generate a hard disk image than can be used by QEMU.

The first step is to create a hard-disk image (c.img) using qemu-img:

```
qemu-img create c.img 2M
```

We need now to partition the disk using fdisk:

```
fdisk ./c.img

# Switch to Expert commands
> x

# Change number of cylinders (1-1048576)
> c
> 4

# Change number of heads (1-256, default 16):
> h
> 16

# Change number of sectors/track (1-63, default 63)
> s
> 63

# Return to main menu
> r

# Add a new partition
> n

# Choose primary partition
> p

# Choose partition number
> 1

# Choose first cylinder (1-4, default 1)
> 1

# Choose last cylinder, +cylinders or +size{K,M,G} (1-4, default 4)
> 4

# Toggle bootable flag
> a

# Choose first partition for bootable flag
> 1

# Write table to disk and exit
> w
```

We need now to attach the created partition to the loop-device (which allows a file to be access like a block device) using losetup. The offset of the partition is passed as an argument and calculated using: **offset= start_sector * bytes_by_sector**.

Using ```fdisk -l -u c.img```, you get: 63 * 512 = 32356.

```
losetup -o 32256 /dev/loop1 ./c.img
```

We create a EXT2 filesystem on this new device using:

```
mke2fs /dev/loop1
```

We copy our files on a mounted disk:

```
mount  /dev/loop1 /mnt/
cp -R bootdisk/* /mnt/
umount /mnt/
```

Install GRUB on the disk:

```
grub --device-map=/dev/null << EOF
device (hd0) ./c.img
geometry (hd0) 4 16 63
root (hd0,0)
setup (hd0)
quit
EOF
```

And finally we detach the loop device:

```
losetup -d /dev/loop1
```
